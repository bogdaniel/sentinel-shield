# Production Readiness Audit (v0.1.13, maturity note v0.1.16)

> **v0.1.16:** the canonical maturity label per tool is in [`product-status.md`](product-status.md).
> The A–F grades below map to those labels: **A→`proven`, B→`supported`, C→`experimental`,
> D→`template-only`, F→`manual`/`non-gating`/`not-ready`.** Each tool has exactly one label there.
>
> **v0.1.17 — how to promote a C (main-gate) tool to live-validated.** Run it branch-safely via
> `scripts/run-main-gate-validation.sh --tool <name>` on a real consumer (locally or in a
> `pull_request` job), confirm it produced a real `reports/raw/<name>.json` (status `pass` in
> `main-gate-validation-tools.json`), review the parsed summary key, then record the run +
> raw→key evidence here and in [`pilot-consumers.md`](pilot-consumers.md). The harness running a tool
> is **not** sufficient — the evidence (real report + reviewed severity) is what promotes it.

Brutally honest status of every tool. **A tool is only "proven-live" if it ran in real CI
(the zenchron-tools pilot) or is exercised by a deterministic self-test fixture with stable
output handling.** Most v0.1.12 additions are **fixture-validated, not live-validated**.

## Classification
- **A. proven-live** — ran green in a real consumer CI (zenchron-tools) OR full deterministic fixture + stable parser.
- **B. implemented-but-fixture-only** — collector + self-test fixture (deterministic), no live consumer run yet.
- **C. collector-only** — collector exists, covered only by generic tests; parser not hardened.
- **D. template-only** — workflow/docs exist; not executed by default.
- **E. documented-only** — declared/reserved; no default emitter.
- **F. not production-ready** — manual/non-deterministic; do not rely on as a gate.

## Honest summary
- **Proven-live (A): the original core** (gitleaks, app-Semgrep, PHPStan, PHPUnit, composer audit, Hadolint, base-digest, GH-pins, Trivy-fs) — validated on the zenchron-tools pilot — **plus this repo's own ci-self-test**.
- **Everything added in v0.1.12 is B/C/D/F**: collector + deterministic self-test fixture, but **not yet live-validated** against a real consumer. The Sentinel Shield *integration* (collector → key → gate) is tested; the *scanner binary execution* and severity fidelity are not.
- **DAST (ZAP/Nuclei) and AI review are not production gates** — manual/allowlisted and non-deterministic respectively.
- **No tool's scanner binary is bundled.** Image/action digests must be pinned by the consumer before production (see [pinned-tool-references.md](pinned-tool-references.md)).

**Sentinel Shield is production-ready as a release-gate ENGINE** (resolver/enforcer/builder/install/sync/self-test are A-grade, fixture- and self-gated). **It is NOT a turnkey "all 30 scanners proven" product** — most scanner integrations are supported/experimental and require a live consumer run + digest pinning to promote to proven.

## v0.1.15 live-validation update (evidence-based promotions)

Evidence: consumer **bogdaniel/zenchron-tools**, workflow `sentinel-shield-pr-fast-validation.yml`,
**run 27170148123** (+ baseline run 27170126445, PASS). Promotions cite the raw report + summary key.

| Tool | Promotion | Evidence (raw → summary key) |
|---|---|---|
| Pint/PHP-CS-Fixer (php-style) | supported → **live-validated** | `php-style.json` (6114B) → `style_violations`=88 (real) |
| TypeScript --noEmit | supported → **live-validated** | `typescript.json` → `type_errors`=0 |
| dependency-policy (lockfile) | supported → **live-validated** | `dependency-policy.json` → `dependency_policy_violations`=0 (detector ran; composer.lock+package-lock present) |
| Semgrep (app) | proven, **config hardened** | curated `semgrep/app` → 0 critical / 0 high / 25 medium, 118 scan errors (vs `--config=auto`: 7/16, 341 errors). **Never use --config=auto.** |
| php-syntax, PHPStan, composer audit, npm audit, Hadolint, GH-pin audit, docker-base-digest | remain **proven/live** | unchanged from v0.1.13/zenchron baseline |

**NOT promoted (still supported/experimental — not exercised):** Psalm, Deptrac, ESLint
(zenchron does not configure them → runner correctly reported `not-configured`/`unavailable`,
no fake). CodeQL, OSV, Trivy-fs, Syft, Grype, Dependency-Check, Checkov/Conftest/Terrascan,
Dockle — `sentinel-shield-main-validation.yml` is workflow_dispatch-only and not dispatchable
from a feature branch until merged to default; **not live-validated this pass.** DAST (ZAP/
Nuclei) + AI review remain manual/non-gating, **not validated.**

---

## v0.1.18 main-gate promotions (evidence run 27214865086)
Promoted to **A / live-validated** (zenchron-tools, sentinel-shield-main-validation): CodeQL
(codeql.json → 0/0/11 medium), OSV-Scanner (→ 1 high), Trivy-fs (→ clean), Syft SBOM
(sbom.spdx.json valid). NOT promoted (no live evidence): Grype, OWASP Dependency-Check, Dockle
(binary/image absent), Deptrac (no deptrac.yaml), Checkov/Conftest/Terrascan (no IaC). Baseline
run 27214863297 FAILED on a real npm critical — correct gate behavior, not suppressed. Canonical:
[`main-gate-live-evidence.md`](main-gate-live-evidence.md).

## v0.1.19 — main-gate execution hardening
Grype (SBOM-first/fs/container), Dependency-Check (disabled-default; nightly), Dockle (image-gated)
have hardened execution paths + env vars, but are **NOT promoted** (no live consumer artifact).
Semgrep 1.165.0 fixture-verified (0 parser errors), not consumer-verified. See
[`main-gate-execution-hardening-v0.1.19.md`](main-gate-execution-hardening-v0.1.19.md) and
[`main-gate-live-evidence.md`](main-gate-live-evidence.md). DAST/Nuclei/AI unchanged (manual/non-gating).

---

## v0.1.20 execution-path promotions (evidence run 27239206382)
Promoted to **A / live-validated**: **Grype** (SBOM-first, grype.json valid, collector → *_vulnerabilities), **Dockle** (built base image, dockle.json → container_image_violations=1). **Semgrep 1.165.0 consumer-verified** (0 parser errors on real `Modules/**/app`, vs 118 on 1.90.0; 25 medium visible). NOT promoted: **Dependency-Check** (attempted; cold NVD exceeds CI budget — nightly with warm cache). Deptrac/IaC not-configured. Canonical: [`main-gate-live-evidence.md`](main-gate-live-evidence.md).

## v0.1.21 — Dependency-Check nightly hardening + scanner digest pinning
**OWASP Dependency-Check** stays **C / attempted, not live-validated** (no real artifact). v0.1.21
delivers the reliable execution path, not a promotion: a cached nightly job (monthly NVD
`actions/cache`, foreground, `if: always()` upload) + a hardened wrapper (keeps valid-JSON-on-non-zero,
discards partial output, optional `timeout`). See
[`dependency-check-nightly-strategy.md`](dependency-check-nightly-strategy.md). Validated scanner
images got **resolved digests** (2026-06-10, not invented) + template override env vars — Semgrep
`sha256:f4791a54…`, Grype `sha256:7a9fc7f8…`, Dockle `sha256:eade932f…`
([`scanner-image-digest-pinning.md`](scanner-image-digest-pinning.md)). Supply-chain hardening; the
A/C grades above are unchanged.
