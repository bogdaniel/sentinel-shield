# Changelog

All notable changes to Sentinel Shield are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). This project is
pre-1.0; the first tag is `v0.1.0`.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] — trivy-action transitive-pin fix

### Fixed

- **`aquasecurity/trivy-action` bumped to `v0.36.0`.** `v0.30.0` resolved as a tag
  but transitively pinned `aquasecurity/setup-trivy@v0.2.2`, a tag that no longer
  exists, so job setup still failed with "Unable to resolve action
  …setup-trivy@v0.2.2". `v0.36.0` pins `setup-trivy` by commit SHA, so it always
  resolves. Applied across `ci-security.yml`, `ci-pipeline.yml`, `ci-docker.yml`,
  and the example workflow. (Supersedes the partial `v0.1.1` trivy fix.)

## [0.1.1] — workflow fixes from first GitHub-runner validation

### Fixed

- **`aquasecurity/trivy-action` version pin** corrected from the non-existent
  `0.30.0` to `v0.30.0` (the action's tags are `v`-prefixed); later found
  insufficient (see 0.1.2). Affected
  `ci-security.yml`, `ci-pipeline.yml`, `ci-docker.yml`, and the Laravel+React+Docker
  example workflow. The bad pin failed job setup with
  "Unable to resolve action …@0.30.0".
- **`actions/setup-node` cache** (`cache: npm`) removed from the fixture-capable
  workflows (`ci-pipeline.yml`, example `sentinel-shield.yml`) because it fails when
  no lockfile is present (minimal/report-only repos without `package.json`).
  `ci-node.yml` (a Node-project-only workflow) keeps the cache.

Both were found by the first real GitHub Actions fixture run; the Sentinel Shield
scripts (resolver/builder/enforcer) were unaffected.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- **Baseline & governance.** Top-level standards (`README.md`,
  `SECURITY-STANDARD.md`, `RELEASE-GATES.md`) and the `docs/` governance set:
  adoption guide, severity policy, exception policy, secure-coding standard,
  Docker and GitHub Actions security, dependency policy, architecture
  boundaries, and the project-readiness checklist. Defines the four adoption
  modes (`report-only`, `baseline`, `strict`, `regulated`) and the security
  doctrine.
- **Per-stack profiles.** Laravel and Symfony (PHPStan/Larastan, Psalm + taint,
  Pint/PHP-CS-Fixer, Deptrac, Rector), Node and React (ESLint flat configs,
  strict `tsconfig`, Knip, audit-ci, Vite security guide), and Docker (hardened
  Dockerfile/Compose references, Hadolint, Trivy).
- **Reusable CI workflows.** PHP, Node, Docker, security (SAST/secrets/deps/SBOM),
  CodeQL, ZAP (staging-only), and the release-gate aggregator, plus Dependabot
  and CodeQL config. Minimal permissions and `master`-branch examples.
- **Semgrep rules** for generic PHP, Laravel, Symfony, generic JS, Node, React,
  and Docker.
- **OPA/Rego policies** for Docker/Compose, GitHub Actions, Terraform, and
  production env config, plus the accepted-risk exception template.
- **Templates.** Pull request, security review, STRIDE-lite threat model,
  one-page ADR, and production-readiness report.
- **Local automation scripts** (POSIX `sh`): stack detection, PHP/Node quality
  runners, local security sweep, report generator, safe `install-baseline`
  (dry-run by default), and a non-destructive `sync-baseline` stub.
- **Gate resolver** (`scripts/resolve-gates.sh`): reads
  `.sentinel-shield/profile.yaml` and resolves the adoption mode into
  machine-readable `SENTINEL_SHIELD_FAIL_ON_*` flags
  (`sentinel-shield-gates.{env,json,md}`). Prefers `yq` v4, with a
  canonical-format awk/sed fallback. Shared shell library in
  `scripts/lib/sentinel-shield-common.sh`; canonical `templates/profile.yaml`;
  documented in `docs/gate-resolution.md`.
- **Gate enforcer** (`scripts/enforce-gates.sh`): consumes the resolved flags
  plus a normalized `reports/security-summary.json` and decides pass/fail
  (exit `0`/`1`/`2`). The gates `.env` is validated line-by-line and never
  blind-sourced; JSON is parsed only with `jq`; a missing required summary key
  is an error, never a silent zero. Ships the `security-summary.json` contract:
  JSON Schema (`schemas/security-summary.schema.json`), canonical example, and
  `docs/security-summary-schema.md`.
- **Repository hygiene.** `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and a
  `Makefile` wrapper over the scripts.

### Security

- Audit-hardened the baseline: fixed malformed XML (double-hyphen in comments),
  removed fabricated/invalid GitHub Action SHA pins (converted to version tags
  with a pin-to-SHA note), fixed `set -e` foot-guns in shell, corrected a Node
  quality-runner binary bug, and made report generation portable.
- Enforcer rejects suspicious `.env` lines (command substitution, backticks,
  shell metacharacters) instead of sourcing them.

### Notes

- Sentinel Shield does **not** yet ship per-scanner adapters that emit
  `security-summary.json`; producing it is currently the consuming project's
  responsibility. The enforcement layer defines and enforces the target contract.
- GitHub Action references use version tags for readability; pin them to commit
  SHAs in sensitive workflows before production use
  (`docs/github-actions-security.md`).
